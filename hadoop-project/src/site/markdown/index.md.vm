Apache Hadoop ${project.version}
================================

<<<<<<< HEAD
Apache Hadoop ${project.version} is a minor release in the 2.x.y release
line, building upon the previous stable release 2.4.1.

Here is a short overview of the major features and improvements.

*   Common

    *   Authentication improvements when using an HTTP proxy server. This is
        useful when accessing WebHDFS via a proxy server.

    *   A new Hadoop metrics sink that allows writing directly to Graphite.

    *   [Specification work](./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/filesystem/index.html)
        related to the Hadoop Compatible Filesystem (HCFS) effort.

*   HDFS

    *   Support for POSIX-style filesystem extended attributes. See the
        [user documentation](./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/ExtendedAttributes.html)
        for more details.

    *   Using the OfflineImageViewer, clients can now browse an fsimage via
        the WebHDFS API.

    *   The NFS gateway received a number of supportability improvements and
        bug fixes. The Hadoop portmapper is no longer required to run the gateway,
        and the gateway is now able to reject connections from unprivileged ports.

    *   The SecondaryNameNode, JournalNode, and DataNode web UIs have been
        modernized with HTML5 and Javascript.

*   YARN

    *   YARN's REST APIs now support write/modify operations. Users can submit and
        kill applications through REST APIs.

    *   The timeline store in YARN, used for storing generic and
        application-specific information for applications, supports authentication
        through Kerberos.

    *   The Fair Scheduler supports dynamic hierarchical user queues, user queues
        are created dynamically at runtime under any specified parent-queue.
=======
Apache Hadoop ${project.version} consists of significant
improvements over the previous stable release (hadoop-1.x).

Here is a short overview of the improvments to both HDFS and MapReduce.

* HDFS Federation

    In order to scale the name service horizontally, federation uses
    multiple independent Namenodes/Namespaces. The Namenodes are
    federated, that is, the Namenodes are independent and don't require
    coordination with each other. The datanodes are used as common storage
    for blocks by all the Namenodes. Each datanode registers with all the
    Namenodes in the cluster. Datanodes send periodic heartbeats and block
    reports and handles commands from the Namenodes.

    More details are available in the
    [HDFS Federation](./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/Federation.html)
    document.

* MapReduce NextGen aka YARN aka MRv2

    The new architecture introduced in hadoop-0.23, divides the two major
    functions of the JobTracker: resource management and job life-cycle
    management into separate components.
    
    The new ResourceManager manages the global assignment of compute
    resources to applications and the per-application
    ApplicationMaster manages the applicationâ€š scheduling and
    coordination.

    An application is either a single job in the sense of classic
    MapReduce jobs or a DAG of such jobs.

    The ResourceManager and per-machine NodeManager daemon, which
    manages the user processes on that machine, form the computation
    fabric.

    The per-application ApplicationMaster is, in effect, a framework
    specific library and is tasked with negotiating resources from the
    ResourceManager and working with the NodeManager(s) to execute and
    monitor the tasks.

    More details are available in the
    [YARN](./hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html) document.
